          recipient(s)
        subject (str): Subject of the email.
        html (str): html representation of the email's content.
        from_ (str, optional): `From` field. Defaults to env var
          `MONITORENV_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS`.
        cc (Union[str, List[str]], optional): `Cc` field with optional email address

          system to attach to the email. These images can be displayed in the html body
          of the email by referencing them in the `src` attribute of an `<img>` tag as
          `cid:<image_name>`, where `<image_name>` is the image file's name.

          For example: `/a/b/c/my_image_123.png` can be included in the html message
          as :

            `<img src="cid:my_image_123.png">` in the html message.

          Defaults to None.
        attachments (dict, optional): `dict` of attachments to add to the email.
          Consists of {filename : bytes} value pairs. Defaults

    recipient that was refused.  Each entry contains a tuple of the SMTP
    error code and the accompanying error message sent by the server, like :
